EVENT-DRIVEN ARCHITECTURE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I BELIEVE THIS ARCHITECTURE STYLE COULD BE USEFUL FOR OUR PROJECT, BECAUSE IT'S EASILY APPLIABLE TO OUR CASE.
EVENT-DRIVEN-ARCHITECTURE IS A SOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE PARADIGM PROMOTING THE PRODUCTION, DETECTION, CONSUPTION
OF, AND REACTION TO EVENTS. THESE EVENTS IN OUR CASE COULD BE FOR EXAMPLE WHEN A PERSON GOES FROM "NORMAL"
TO "INFECTED", AND ALSO COULD WORK FOR REGIONS THAT GO FROM NOT HAVING A RESTRICTION TO HAVING IT, OR THE
OTHER WAY AROUND.
