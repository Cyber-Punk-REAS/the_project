RULE-BASED STYLE
--------------------------------------

I'VE CHOSEN THIS PATTERN BECAUSE IT ALLOWS US TO INTERPRET INFORMATION IN A USEFUL WAY. THIS KIND OF PATTERN HINGES ON A KNOWLEDGE BASE IN ORDER TO MAKE DEDUCTIONS. IN OUR CASE, THIS WILL BE EXTREMELY HELPFUL WHEN IT COMES 
TO COMPARING RESULTS AND SHOWING WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S BEEN AN IMPROVEMENT REGARDING INFECTIONS. ON TOP OF THAT, THE BEHAVIOR OF THE APPLICATION CAN BE VERY EASILY MODIFIED THROUGH ADDITION OR DELETION OF RULES 
(CONSTRAINTS, PARAMETERS...) FROM THE KNOWLEDGE BASE.

IN A NUTSHELL, AS WE'RE GOING TO BE MODIFYING PARAMETERS AND ADDING/DELETING CONSTRAINTS ALL THE TIME, THIS ARCHITECTURE STYLE IS THE ONE THAT FITS BEST FROM MY POINT OF VIEW.
