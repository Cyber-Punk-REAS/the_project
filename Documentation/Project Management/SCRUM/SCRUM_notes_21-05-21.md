## Daniel Delgado 
### What have you done in the last days?
- Finished the last errors in the sequence diagram. Also corrected the necessary error for generating the RestrictionPolicy code, and finished the test's documentation.
### What will you do until next SCRUM meeting?
- Finish the testing and review the rest of the team testing code.
### What problems have you encountered?
- Some problems with github that involved some of the members of the team, but it is already resolved. Also I have some doubts about the implementation of the test.

## Alejandro Cano Caldero
### What have you done in the last days?
- I've been working on the simulation test case and defining the attributes that would be needed in order to perform the simulation.
- I've also devoted myself to carrying out the tasks related to the Architecture Style and Design Principle
### What will you do until next SCRUM meeting?
- I'll keep on working on the test case
- I'll be one of the team members who will work on the algorithm itself. 
### What problems have you encountered?
- I didn't know how to get started with the test case since I couldn't predict the results that I would obtain when running the simulation.

## Pablo Gonzalez Diaz
### What have you done in the last days?
- Made Restriction.java's implementation and arranged it's Test planning.
### What will you do until next SCRUM meeting?
- Implement said tests.
### What problems have you encountered?
- Learning how other mates did the testing skeleton, and problems with the main branch and merging my branch with the programming branch.## Jesús Villén Ruiz

## Jesús Villén Ruiz
### What have you done in the last days?
- Started with the testing of Result.java
- Create Result.java
- Fix some error in the class diagram to generate the code.
### What will you do until next SCRUM meeting?
- Work in testing.
- Decide which design pattern to use.
### What problems have you encountered?
- At first I didn't know very well how to do a correct test and that is why it took me so much 
work to get started. I finally solved it by asking some classmates.## Carlos Javier Gutiérrez Sánchez

## Carlos Javier Gutiérrez Sánchez
### What have you done in the last days?
- Reviewed the class diagram and worked on the attributes with Nacho.
- Helped with a git issue.
- Started with the test plan (WIP).
### What will you do until next SCRUM meeting?
- Review test cases and classes.
- Choose a design principle and explain how it could be applied to the SUD.
### What problems have you encountered?
- I'm not sure if we have to create a new project or everyone uses the same.
- We had a problem with git. Someone uploaded an old version of the diagrams.

## Ignacio Lopezosa Serrano
### What have you done in the last days?
- Helped with the GitHub issue.
- Almost finished the Test Plans for Region class.
- Created GitHub organization to improve git workflow and avoid errors.
### What will you do until next SCRUM meeting?
- Work on the simulation's algorithm.
- Finsh test plans.
- Start with implementations.
- Organize reviews for TDD.
### What problems have you encountered?
- The GitHub problem uploading outdated commits.
- The class diagram having unnamed attributes and duplicated relations.

## Adrián Meis Asensi
### What have you done in the last days?
- Create the first version of my test plan
- Research and find a possible Design Principle for the SUD
- Generate a first version of the ParameterProfile java class
### What will you do until next SCRUM meeting?
- Continue with the test plan/tests for the ParameterProfile class
### What problems have you encountered?
- I had problems with generating the code as the associations on the design model didnt have names on them.
