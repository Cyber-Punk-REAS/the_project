## Alejandro Cano Caldero
### What have you done in the last days?
- We've set up the website interface and started with the configuration of the database.
- We created a new branch called Programming in which we are going to be uploading our process of the project.
### What will you do until next SCRUM meeting?
- I'm going to keep on implementing the classes and the relations so as to be able to store data into the database and show such data.
### What problems have you encountered?
- I encountered some issues that were accounted for by the lack of some dependencies that were required but I finally managed to overcome those hardships.
- Also, the synchronization with GitHub took us a little bit longer than expected but everything turned out fine in the end.

## Pablo Gonzalez Diaz
### What have you done in the last days?
- Speficied the database configuration with my team, and implemented the first version of the Region.java class and the Day.java class. I also reviewed the different diagrams presented by the modeling team.
### What will you do until next SCRUM meeting?
- Polish the class implementations aswell as introduce the remaining ones, and introduce the relations between the classes once the class diagram is presented to us.
### What problems have you encountered?
- Some mishaps with GitHub & Eclipse when we first started, decided finally to use IntelliJ as an alternative (even though my team mates still use Eclipse). Also had to reinstall the IntelliJ JDK as it wasn't being recognized.## Ignacio Lopezosa Serrano
