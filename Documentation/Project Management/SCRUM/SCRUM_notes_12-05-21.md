## Adrián Meis Asensi
### What have you done in the last days?
- Create the Manage Parameter Profiles sequence diagram
- Review the Manage regions sequence diagram
- Add the functions again on the Main Branch master model
- Research and find a possible software style for the SUD
### What will you do until next SCRUM meeting?
- If possible start creating the test for the parameter profile class.
### What problems have you encountered?
- Mainly problems with magicdraw and how the sequence diagrams work on that program.

## Alejandro Cano Caldero
### What have you done in the last days?
- I've created the Run Simulation sequence diagram
- I also looked over the Manage Parameter Profiles sequence diagram
- Added the necessary functions on the Main Branch master model
- Finally, I delved deeply into the subject about Architectural Styles and chose the one that I thought it would fit best.
### What will you do until next SCRUM meeting?
- I'll start working on the development of tests
### What problems have you encountered?
- There were some problems with my sequence diagram at first that I couldn't understand. Nevertheless, everything is crystal clear now.

## Pablo Gonzalez Diaz
### What have you done in the last days?
- Learnt about Architecture Styles and chose one for our project, decided on a favorite from my mates' choices. A couple of very small changes to Java classes.
### What will you do until next SCRUM meeting?
- Start testing the software with my team.
### What problems have you encountered?
- I found it hard to understand some of the Architecture Styles, but eventually understood them with time.

## Carlos Javier Gutiérrez Sánchez
### What have you done in the last days?
- Fix use cases diagram and some relations in the domain diagram
- Manage comparison report sequence diagram
- Review Jesus's model and help him
- Review other students diagrams during a class lesson
### What will you do until next SCRUM meeting?
- Work on tests
- Pick an architectural style
- Analyze our current class diagram and decide which design patterns we should use.
### What problems have you encountered?
- I had some issues understanding the sequence diagram, but everything is clear after asking the teacher.

## Jesús Villén Ruiz
### What have you done in the last days?
- I created the sequence diagram of "ManageResults", and later, once the coordinator joined all the sequence diagrams in the same project, I added the operations that had been removed.
- I have also reviewed the sequence diagram of "ManageRestrictions", I have given my opinion to its creators (all ok) and I have corrected some errors in my diagram with the help of Alejandro and Carlos.
- I have also researched the different existing software architectures, choosing PAC for our project. Afterwards, I have read one by one the opinion of my colleagues, choosing Nacho's as the winner, which was "Component-based development". 
### What will you do until next SCRUM meeting?
- Work in testing.
- Decide which design pattern to use.
### What problems have you encountered?
- At first I didn't know very well how the sequence diagrams work and that is why it took me so much work to get started. I finally solved it by asking some classmates and the teacher.

## Ignacio Lopezosa Serrano
### What have you done in the last days?
- Created Manage Regions sequence diagrams.
- Reviewed Manage Comparison Reports sequence diagrams.
- Merged all sequence diagrams with Master.mdzip.
- Organized meetings and workload delegation.
- Researched architecture style for project.
- Helped fixing class diagram.
### What will you do until next SCRUM meeting?
- Work on tests.
- Choose best fitting principles for SUD.
- Add attributes and names to classes and relations on Class diagram.
- Organize next SCRUM meeting.
### What problems have you encountered?
- MagicDraw is horrible to merge parts from separate projects.
