I think the Model-view-controller pattern could be a good pick as our SUD will be accessed by the client on a web interface.
This pattern is made up of three components: 
- The model which is the central component, handling all of the data and operations.
- The view which handles what the user would see when using the program.
- The controller which accepts the user inputs and converts it into commands for the model.
This could work very well with our SUD as we need a view for the client to see the results, a controller to introduce the parameters and obviously a central system to handle the simulation. Also this pattern could be modified or used in conjuction with another pattern.
For example, we could use this pattern as the main pattern and also use a secondary one to explain how the model would work internally.
