Model - view - controller (MVC)
--------------------------------------
MY FIRST CHOICE:
I have chosen this architecture because as its name suggests,
 it divides the web application into three parts that would be
 the controller (in our case it would be to introduce the parameters
 as restrictions among others), the model (which would be our simulation),
 and the view (where they will show the results for later, if the 
user wishes, to be able to compare them), and I think it fits very 
well with the project and web page prototype that we have in mind.

MY CHOICE AFTER READING SOME OF THE ARCHITECTURES PROPOSED BY CLASSMATES:

I have read the opinion of Alejandro, who has chosen the RULES BASED STYLE,
 I have found out what this pattern is about and I also find it quite good, 
maybe my positive point is for RULES BASED STYLE.
