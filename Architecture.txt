Presentation–abstraction–control (PAC)
--------------------------------------
MY FIRST CHOICE:
For me the best version is MVC pattern, but I can´t choose this one so... I choose PAC, 
it is an interaction-oriented software architecture, and is somewhat similar to 
model–view–controller (MVC) in that it separates an interactive system into three types of
components responsible for specific aspects of the application's functionality.
The abstraction component retrieves and processes the data, the presentation component
formats the visual and audio presentation of data, and the control component handles 
things such as the flow of control and communication between the other two components.
I have chosen this architecture because
 it divides the web application into three components that would be
 the abstraction (in our case it would be to introduce the parameters
 as restrictions among others), the presentation (which would be our simulation),
 and the control (where they will show the results for later, if the 
user wishes, to be able to compare them), and I think it fits very 
well with the project and web page prototype that we have in mind.

MY CHOICE AFTER READING SOME OF THE ARCHITECTURES PROPOSED BY CLASSMATES:

I have read the opinion of Alejandro, who has chosen the RULES BASED STYLE,
 I have found out what this pattern is about and I also find it quite good, 
maybe my positive point is for RULES BASED STYLE.
